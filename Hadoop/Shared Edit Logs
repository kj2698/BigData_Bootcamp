What is Shared Edit Logs in case of Stand By Name Node in Hadoop 2 x?

Yes, Shared Edit Logs exist in case of hadoop 2.0 as well. Let’s walk through the architecture. This will outline the different components that are built into hadoop to provide this functionality.

In each cluster, two separate machines are configured as NameNodes. In a working cluster, one of the NameNode machine is in the Active state, and the other is in the Standby state.

The Active NameNode is responsible for all client operations in the cluster. The Standby NameNode maintains enough state to provide a fast failover. In order for the Standby node to keep its state synchronized with the Active node, both nodes communicate through a group of separate daemons called JournalNodes. The file system journal logged by the Active NameNode at the JournalNodes is consumed by the Standby NameNode to keep it’s file system namespace in sync with the Active.

In order to provide a fast failover, it is also necessary that the Standby node have up-to-date information of the location of blocks in your cluster. DataNodes are configured with the location of both the NameNodes and send block location information and heartbeats to both NameNode machines.

The ZooKeeper Failover Controller (ZKFC) is responsible for HA Monitoring of the NameNode service and for automatic failover when the Active NameNode is unavailable. There are two ZKFC processes – one on each NameNode machine. ZKFC uses the Zookeeper Service for coordination in determining which is the Active NameNode and in determining when to failover to the Standby NameNode.

Quorum journal manager (QJM) in the NameNode writes file system journal logs to the journal nodes. A journal log is considered successfully written only when it is written to majority of the journal nodes. Only one of the Namenodes can achieve this quorum write. In the event of split-brain scenario this ensure that the file system metadata will not be corrupted by two active NameNodes.

In HA setup, HDFS clients are configured with a logical name service URI and the two NameNodes corresponding to it. The clients perform source side failover. When a client cannot connect to a NameNode or if the NameNode is in standby mode, it performs fail over to the other NameNode.
