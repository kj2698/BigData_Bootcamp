# Abstracting Data with RDDs
In this chapter, we will cover how to work with Apache Spark Resilient Distributed Datasets. You will learn the following recipes:

Creating RDDs

Reading data from files

Overview of RDD transformations

Overview of RDD actions

Pitfalls of using RDDs

# Introduction
Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) are collections of immutable JVM objects that are distributed across an Apache Spark cluster. Data in an RDD is split into chunks based on a key and then dispersed across all the executor nodes. RDDs are highly resilient, that is, there are able to recover quickly from any issues as the same data chunks are replicated across multiple executor nodes. Thus, even if one executor fails, another will still process the data. This allows you to perform your functional calculations against your dataset very quickly by harnessing the power of multiple nodes. RDDs keep a log of all the execution steps applied to each chunk. This, on top of the data replication, speeds up the computations and, if anything goes wrong, RDDs can still recover the portion of the data lost due to an executor error.

While it is common to lose a node in distributed environments (for example, due to connectivity issues, hardware problems), distribution and replication of the data defends against data loss, while data lineage allows the system to recover quickly.
