Views are just the simplified name which is given to a complex query.
views dont store the data, it only stores the structure of the views like column names and data types.
views reduces the complexity of a query and it can be used by a non tech person as well.
when we query a view, behind the scene it runs the query which is used to create that view itself.

create view v1 as select * from t1;

here I have created a view v1, now if I want to run the same query again it will throw error saying view already exists.
you can use,

create or replace view v1 as select * from t1;
this won't give error, if view exits it will replace v1 and if the view does not exists then it will create the new view.

if you want to update the col name then you can use alter view command.

t1 was used to create v1 then let say if we add a new col to t1, then if we query v1 so is it going to show the new col?
the ans is no it will not show the new column becoz we already mentioned on querying a new it runs the query which was used to create it,
but it also stores the schema of the view. hence new col will not appear.
