Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.

However, there are two major pitfalls in Python sets: 

The set doesnâ€™t maintain elements in any particular order.
Only instances of immutable types can be added to a Python set.
we cannot add list and dictionary and set into python set whereas tuples can be added.

only immutable objects (strings, integers, floats, frozensets, tuples of immutables) are hashable.
